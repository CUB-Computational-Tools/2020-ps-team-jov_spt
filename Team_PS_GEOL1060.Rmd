##Using Data Sets 

> We'll first load some R packages that will allow us to make our code do things like pull in data sets from a folder or make a plot. *R packages* are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community. They improve the existing base fuctionalities of R and expand what you can achieve with your code. 
But what is a function?

> A *function* is a conjunction of code that achieves a specific task. This code can be 'called' using the function's given name. What the function ultimately does is take in data and return a result based on that function's 'inner' code. 

```{r load packages}
# The library() function loads each package. You need to do this so R can find the functions you need from a certain package. Once the package loads all the different functions associated with it are usable. 
library(tidyverse) #these are all different libraries that help the code do different things
library(readxl)#the blue "library" part tells R that this is a package it should load and the black writing is the name of the specific package(in this case "readxl" which helps us read Excel files into R)
library(ggplot2)#this library, for example, helps us make plots of our data. 
#notice that because there is a "#" symbol before all of the note text above, it's all just comments that don't affect the code!
```

###Modern $CO_2$ Concentration

At Mauna Loa, NOAA has data looking at the parts per million concentration of $CO_2$


Now, we'll load PETM data of estimated SST (degrees Celsius):
```{r load data}
PETM_data <- #we are making a new data set called "PETM_data" 
  read_excel("data/FAKE_PETM_SST_data.xlsx") #we are reading in the excel file with our data (which is in the data folder)
```

Plot the estimated SST (degrees Celcius) data over time:
```{r plot PETM data}
SSTvAge <- #We create a new plot that's named "SSTvAge"
ggplot(PETM_data, aes(x = Age, y = SST)) + #we call the function ggplot to input our data set and assign x and y variables
geom_line(size = 0.5, color = 'red')+ #We define a red line to connect our data points
labs(y = "SST (degrees C)", x = "Age (Ma)", title = "SST (degrees Celcius) vs Age (Ma) during the PETM from Stokke et al. (2020)" )+ #We give our graph labels
theme_bw() #We make the background grid theme/color black and white 
SSTvAge
```
