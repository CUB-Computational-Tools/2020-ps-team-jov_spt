# GEOL 1060 - Ocean Acidification

This is the repository for the ocean acidification lesson for the GEOL 1060 course. Here you will find two Jupyter Notebooks, one for part 1 of the lesson, and one for part 2 of the lesson. Part 1 will focus on ocean acidification in modern oceans and an introduction to R programming and Jupyter Notebook. Part 2 will focus on a case study on ocean acidification during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
