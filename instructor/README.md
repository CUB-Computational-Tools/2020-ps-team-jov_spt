This directory contains the files meant for the instructor of this lesson.

The `Ocean_Acidification_Key.ipynb` file is an answer key for the problem set. It includes all of the answers to the questions plus has all the code bits (the ones the students have to fill out) necessary to run the whole Jupyter Notebook.

The `OceanAcidification_Full_Lesson.ipynb` file has a version of the ocean acidification lesson that has both parts 1 and 2 in a single Jupyter Notebook. The code bits (the ones the students have to fill out) necessary to run the whole Jupyter Notebook are included in this file. If you'd like to use this file for the class, remove all the code bits so students can fill them out themselves.
